Loan limits set a maximum dollar amount on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) are willing to buy or guarantee. If a loan exceeds this limit, a borrower cannot use a conventional loan, and they will have to apply for a Jumbo loan (yes, that's the real name!). Loan limits are set annually based on the market to prevent overborrowing and foreclosures. \n","\n","## CBSA Number and FIPs Code:\n","\n","### CBSA... \n","stands for Core-Based Statistical Area and is defined as a U.S. geographic area that consists of one or more counties connected by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties.
